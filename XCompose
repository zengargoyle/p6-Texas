# %L is the current locale's default Compose file If you have your own
# ~/.XCompose setting you probably want to include the defaults.  Usually
# it's found somewhere like: '/usr/share/X11/$LANG/Compose'.
#include "%L"

# I prefer to copy the default Compose into ~/.XCompose.$LANG
# (it makes `fgrep ??? ~/.XCompose.*` an easy way to find compose combinations.

# %H is the users $HOME

# default locale
include "%H/.XCompose.en_US.UTF-8"

# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kragen/xcompose/master/dotXCompose
include "%H/.XCompose.kragen"

# Perl6 TEXAS mappings
include "%H/.XCompose.perl6"

# personal stuff goes here
include "%H/.XCompose.local"
